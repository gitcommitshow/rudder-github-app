# Rudder GitHub App

A Node.js server for GitHub app to assist external contributors and save maintainers' time

## Roadmap

- [x] When an external contributor (not the internal team) raises a PR, post a comment to sign CLA and label PR `Pending CLA`
- [x] On signing CLA, remove `Pending CLA` label from all the PRs of that user. Never ask that user to sign the CLA on any of our repo in future
- [x] On `rudder-transformer` PR merge, post a comment to raise PR in `integrations-config`
- [ ] On `integrations-config` PR merge, psot a comment to join Slack's product-releases channel to get notified when that integration goes live
- [ ] On `integrations-config` PR merge, post a comment to raise PR in `rudder-docs`
- [x] List of open PRs by external contributors
- [ ] Automated docs/code improvement pipeline
  - [ ] Configuration page or a labelled gh issue - directory/filename, no. of tiny PRs per week, no. of big PRs every month, changes per file
  - [ ] Review files based on configurations, prioritize, and create issues with instructions for the change
  - [ ] On issue approval (label change), execute the task (the code change), and raise PR

## Requirements

- Node.js 20 or higher
- A GitHub App subscribed to **Pull Request** events and with the following permissions:
  - Pull requests: Read & write
  - Metadata: Read-only
- Your GitHub App Webhook must be configured to receive events at a URL that is accessible from the internet.
- (Only for local development) A tunnel to expose your local server to the internet (e.g. [smee](https://smee.io/), [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) or [cloudflared](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-apps/install-and-setup/tunnel-guide/local/))

## Development setup

1. Clone this repository.
2. Create a `.env` file similar to `.env.example` and set actual values. If you are using GitHub Enterprise Server, also include a `ENTERPRISE_HOSTNAME` variable and set the value to the name of your GitHub Enterprise Server instance.
3. Install dependencies with `npm install`.
4. Start the server with `npm run server`.
5. Ensure your server is reachable from the internet.
    - If you're using `smee`, run `smee -u <smee_url> -t http://localhost:3000/api/webhook`.
6. Ensure your GitHub App includes at least one repository on its installations.

## Deployment

### Using `Docker`

1. [Register a GitHub app](https://docs.github.com/en/apps/creating-github-apps/registering-a-github-app/registering-a-github-app) for your GitHub organization. Make sure to activate the webhook with webhook url `https://YOUR_WEBSITE/api/webhook` in your app with a secret. Enable Permissions & Events as you may need, at minimum pull_request and issue related events should be enabled.
2. InstallÂ your GitHub app in all the repos where you need this app.
3. Clone this repo OR download the [`build/docker-compose.yml`](./build/docker-compose.yml) to install via dockerhub image
4. Update `docker-compose.yml` environment variables with the details received from the step 2
> To convert GitHub App's private key to base64, use this command - `openssl base64 -in /path/to/original-private-key.pem -out ./base64EncodedKey.txt -A`
5. Run `docker-componse build` to build the service
6. Run `docker-compose up` to create and start the container
7. Test by visiting `http://localhost:3000` OR whatever `WEBSITE_ADDRESS` environment variable you've configured

## Usage

With your server running, you can now create a pull request on any repository that
your app can access. GitHub will emit a `pull_request.opened` event and will deliver
the corresponding Webhook [payload](https://docs.github.com/webhooks-and-events/webhooks/webhook-events-and-payloads#pull_request) to your server.

The server in this example listens for `pull_request.opened` events and acts on
them by creating a comment on the pull request, with the message in `message.md`,
using the [octokit.js rest methods](https://github.com/octokit/octokit.js#octokitrest-endpoint-methods).

## Security considerations

To keep things simple, this example reads the `GITHUB_APP_PRIVATE_KEY` from the
environment. A more secure and recommended approach is to use a secrets management system
like [Vault](https://www.vaultproject.io/use-cases/key-management), or one offered
by major cloud providers:
[Azure Key Vault](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/key-vault/secrets/quick-create-node?tabs=windows),
[AWS Secrets Manager](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSJavaScriptSDK/v3/latest/clients/client-secrets-manager/),
[Google Secret Manager](https://cloud.google.com/nodejs/docs/reference/secret-manager/latest),
etc.
